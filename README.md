# Getting Started With Node.js

1.  <h2> Monolithic architecture</h2>
Monolithic architecture refers to a software application design where the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In a  monolithic architecture, all the different components and functionalities of the application are tightly coupled together and run as a single process.<br>
An  example of a monolithic architecture is a traditional e-commerce website  where all the different components and functionalities of the  website, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and payment processing, would be tightly coupled together and run as a single process.<br>
The disadvantage of this architecture is that any changes or updates <br>to one part of the application may require the entire application to be rebuilt and redeployed.<br>

2.  <h2>Microservices </h2>
Microservice architecture is a software application design that involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. In a microservice architecture, each service is responsible for performing a specific function or set of functions, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of the other services.<br>
Each microservice typically runs in its own process and can be developed using a different programming language or technology stack. The services are loosely coupled and communicate with each other using lightweight protocols like HTTP or message queues.<br>

3.  <h2>Backend architecture appeals to me</h2>
Backend architecture refers to the design and organization of the server-side components of a software application. The backend architecture is responsible for handling data storage, processing, and management, as well as communication with the client-side components of the application.<br>
/**The backend architecture for me is Microservices architecture because od the following features:**/
1. Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently of the other services, allowing the application to handle increasing amounts of traffic.<br>
3. Resilience: Since each microservice is independent, failures in one service do not affect the other services, and the application as a whole can be more resilient.
<br>
3.  Flexibility: Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, allowing developers to choose the best technology stack and development approach for each service.
<br>
4.  Maintainability: Since each microservice is small and focused on a specific set of functions, it is easier to maintain and update the application over time. <br>

4.  <h2>Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?</h2>
Node.js is not a multithreaded language in the same way as traditional multithreaded languages like Java or C++. Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is a single-threaded engine.<br>
However, Node.js does support concurrency through an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple client requests, but it does not block on I/O operations. Instead, it delegates I/O operations to the operating system and uses an event loop to manage the execution of callbacks once the I/O operations complete.
<br>
This event-driven model allows Node.js to handle large numbers of concurrentrequests with relatively low overhead, making it well-suited for building scalable, real-time applications.<br>

5.  <h2>REPL</h2>
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. <br>
In a REPL environment, the user enters a command or code snippet, which is then evaluated by the interpreter or compiler. The result is printed out to the console, and the user can then enter another command or snippet.<br>
