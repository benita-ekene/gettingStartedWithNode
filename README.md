# Getting Started With Node.js

1.  <h2> Monolithic architecture</h2>
Monolithic architecture refers to a software application design where <br> the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In a <br> monolithic architecture, all the different components and functionalities <br> of the application are tightly coupled together and run as a single process.<br>
An  example of a monolithic architecture is a traditional e-commerce <br> website  where all the different components and functionalities of the <br> website, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and <br> payment processing, would be tightly coupled together and run as a single process.<br>
The disadvantage of this architecture is that any changes or updates <br>to one part of the application may require the entire application to be rebuilt and redeployed.<br>

2.  <h2>Microservices </h2>
Microservice architecture is a software application design that involves <br> breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services <br>that communicate with each other through APIs. In a microservice <br>architecture, each service is responsible for performing a specific function or set of functions, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled <br>independently of the other services.<br>
Each microservice typically runs in its own process and can be developed <br>using a different programming language or technology stack. The <br>services are loosely coupled and communicate with each other using <br>lightweight protocols like HTTP or message queues.<br>

3.  <h2>Backend architecture appeals to me</h2>
Backend architecture refers to the design and organization of the server-side<br> components of a software application. The backend architecture<br> is responsible for handling data storage, processing, and management,<br> as well as communication with the client-side components of the application.<br>
/**The backend architecture for me is Microservices architecture because od the following features:**/
1. Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently of the other services, allowing the application to handle increasing amounts of traffic.<br>
3. Resilience: Since each microservice is independent, failures in one service do not affect the other services, and the application as a whole can be more resilient.
<br>
3.  Flexibility: Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, allowing developers to choose the best technology stack and development approach for each service.
<br>
4.  Maintainability: Since each microservice is small and focused on a specific set of functions, it is easier to maintain and update the application over time. <br>

4.  <h2>Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?</h2>
Node.js is not a multithreaded language in the same way as traditional <br>multithreaded languages like Java or C++. Node.js is built on top of <br>the V8 JavaScript engine, which is a single-threaded engine.<br>
However, Node.js does support concurrency through an event-driven and <br>non-blocking I/O model. Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple <br>client requests, but it does not block on I/O operations. Instead, it <br>delegates I/O operations to the operating system and uses an event loop to manage the execution of callbacks once the I/O operations complete.
<br>
This event-driven model allows Node.js to handle large numbers of concurrent<br> requests with relatively low overhead, making it well-suited for building<br> scalable, real-time applications.<br>

5.  <h2>REPL</h2>
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. <br>
In a REPL environment, the user enters a command or code snippet, which is <br>then evaluated by the interpreter or compiler. The result is printed out<br> to the console, and the user can then enter another command or snippet.<br>
